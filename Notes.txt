1. Disallow multiple registrations for a specific Command/Query/Request handler.
	1. Registrar methods will be changed from 'AddxxxHandlerRegistration' to 'RegisterxxxHandler'.
	2. Duplicate registrations will throw exceptions.
2. Consider using the command/query/request manifest as the input into the dispatchers, and subsequently,
   the means to resolve registrations. This means the manifests will in turn hold a reference to the ServiceResolver, and each resolution call
   will in turn be passed unto the internal resolver.

   1. Make sure that all instruction namespaces within a Query/Request/Command Registrar are unique.
